# Frankenfish

Have you ever thought it was strange that the fishing rod only gives you dead fish?
Have you ever thought it was strange that you can't use those fish to make your aquarium, and instead must travel the world
looking for separate, living, fish?
At long last, there is now a solution.

With the power of **⚡Lightning⚡** you can now turn your hard-earned fish supply into vibrant friends for your aquarium!
This datapack turns any dropped fish item that gets struck by lightning into a living fish mob.

**TODO: Video Here**
